# More about this editor:

This is a WYSIWYM editor: what you see is what you mean editor.

The text input is a markup language which supports headings, paragraphs and tables. 
The output is a render which looks better than the preview.

Click on download in the top navbar to download the rendered version of this document.

The heading markers instruct the engine to make the line a heading. 
There are many such symbols and all such instructional symbols will be hidden in the final rendering, leaving only the main content to be read. This reduces clutter. 

The rendered version also has a table of contents, which is automatically generated, and helps you navigate through the document.

# Aligning content

You can align content using the bar | and pilcrow ⁋ symbols.

Observe the difference between the plain text in the editor, and rendered table in the preview. 
Note how the separators are aligned.

|| takadimi takajhaNu takadimi takajhaNu | takadimi takajhaNu | takadimi takajhaNu |
|| takadimi takajhaNu (ta, di,tAMkiTa digutarikiTataka) |

⁋ (digutarikiTataka) dhim, ⁋
⁋ (digutarikiTataka) dhim, ⁋
⁋ (digutarikiTataka) ⁋


The bar is a separator used to show syllables in a rhythm cycle.
The pilcrow is a separator used to show syllables grouped by structure as opposed to syllables grouped by rhythm cycle.

If you have varying number of columns, then you can simply add an empty line to indicate start of a new table.
Try removing the empty line between the | rows and ⁋ rows in the above example and see what happens.

You can insert a pair of pilcrows by typing // (press slash on your keyboard twice)__.

1. Place the cursor on the empty line before this line.
2. Press slash on your keyboard twice. 
It will add two pilcrows and place the cursor in the middle.

You can switch the language by specifying >Language in a separate line like this:

>Language: kannada

⁋ takajhaNu dhim, ⁋
⁋ takajhaNu dhim, ⁋
⁋ takajhaNu ⁋

>Language: off

You can try kannada, telugu, tamil, malayalam and sanskrit. (These have to be
spelt exactly as specified here)__.

There is one more separator: the interpunct · : which is a hidden separator - it will be hidden in the render. Compare the following lines with and without the interpunct:

>Language: kannada

|| takadimi takajhaNu takadimi takajhaNu | takadimi takajhaNu | takadimi takajhaNu ||
|| (ta,; tAMkiTa digutarikiTataka) (ta,di, tAMkiTa digutarikiTataka)  | (digutarikiTataka tAMkiTa digutari | kiTataka ta, dhim, kiTa ta, dhim, nna) ||

|| takadimi takajhaNu · takadimi takajhaNu | takadimi · takajhaNu | takadimi · takajhaNu ||
|| (ta,; tAMkiTa digutarikiTataka) · (ta,di, tAMkiTa digutarikiTataka)  | (digutarikiTataka · tAMkiTa digutari | kiTataka ta, dhim, ·kiTa ta, dhim, nna) ||

>Language: off

You can insert an interpunct by pressing tab on your keyboard.


## Aligning columns

The separators work by creating a table, and each separator makes a new column.

You can specify alignment for each column in a table, by typing >: in a separate line,
and  specifying l, c, and r to align left, center and right respectively.

>: l·r·c·r
|| ತಕಿಟ |ತಕಿಟ |ತಕಿಟ |ತಕಿಟ ||
|| ((ತಾಂಕಿಟ ದಿಗುತರಿಕಿಟತಕ)) |((ತಾಂಕಿಟ ದಿಗುತರಿಕಿಟತಕ)) |((ತಾಂಕಿಟ ದಿಗುತರಿಕಿಟತಕ)) |((ತಾಂಕಿಟ ದಿಗುತರಿಕಿಟತಕ)) ||


Content is aligned left by default.

The alignment will be applied in the render, and the alignment hints will be hidden.

# Underlines

Everything you put within a (pair of parenthesis) is underlined with (a single underline).

((This sentence should have two underlines under it));

You can also have (nested parenthesis (like this)) to add a double underline. 

You can escape underlining by putting two underscores after the parens, 
(like this)__.

# Subscripts and Superscripts

Text within an underscore_Will Be Shown As A SubScript_.  The subscript will be hidden in the render.
For example, 

|| (ತಕಿಟ ತಕಿಟ ತಕಿಟ ತಕಿಟ)_3_ | (ತಧಿಂ,ಗಿಣತೊಂ)_6_ (ತಧಿಂ,ತ(ಕಿಟ)ತೊಂ)_6_ ((ತಾಕಿಟತಕ ತೊಂ,ಕಿಟತೊಂ,))_6_ (ತಾಕಿಟತಕ ತೊಂ,ಕಿಟತೊಂ,)_12_ ||

Superscripts are also ^supported^ similarly.
