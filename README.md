# Carnatic Notation app
Use this app to create carnatic music notation.

## This is work in progress

This app initially focuses on konnakol / mridangam / kanjira / ghatam / morsing notation.

[Click here](https://ragumagu.github.io/carnatic-notation-app/notation_app.html) to open the app.

This application lets you type in English, and generate notation in English, Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and Sanskrit. The transliteration feature is based on the work of Ramadorai Arunkumar (I hope this is correct) who has developed a [Carnatic Music Typesetter](http://arunk.freepgs.com/wordpress/cm-typesetter/about/) and [Unified Transliteration Scheme for Carnatic Music Compositions](http://arunk.freepgs.com/cmtranslit/cmtranslit_scheme.html).
